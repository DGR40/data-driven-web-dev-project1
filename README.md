# data-driven-web-dev-project1
Mid semester project for my Data Driven Web Development course that I completed with a four person team. View the final report to see the graphs that our group created and the justification and explanation behind each visualization. We used D3.js to analyze data regarding happiness levels around the world over the last few years.
